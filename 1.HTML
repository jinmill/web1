<p style="width: 730px;">Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa,
Musk moved to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University.
He transferred to the <strong>University of <u>Pennsylvania</u></strong> two years later,
where he received an economics degree from the Wharton School and a degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences.
He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995
but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career.
He subsequently co-founded Zip2, a web software company,
which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999.</p>
